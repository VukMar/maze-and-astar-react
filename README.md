# Maze Generator and Solver

Welcome to the Maze Generator and Solver project, a fun and interactive maze generation and solving tool created using JavaScript and React. This project allows you to generate custom mazes, visualize them, and even find a solution using the A* algorithm.

## Features

- **Maze Generation:** Create custom mazes by specifying the width and height.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Visualize the generated mazes and explore them.
- **A * Algorithm Solver:** Let the computer solve the maze for you using the A* algorithm.

## Notice

There is no limit to maze size when seting parameters! It can try to generate insanely large mazes witch can break the webpage! Keep it in the range 10 - 100 for best results!

There is still room for improvement, this is something i eneded up creating in a day for practice. Maybe i will return to this to make it neat and a fun interactive maze game to publish on my [website.](https://vukmaric.rs)

The mobile devices have issues when viewing the page! Smaller screen means less viewing area and the maze navigation is harder!
Will try to enhance the mobile usage in the future.
